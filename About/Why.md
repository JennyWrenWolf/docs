# Why IoT App Studio?

Building IoT Server and Edge applications is difficult and time-consuming.  Usually, this starts
with an idea or a set of requirements and potentially a design.  Eventually, you need to turn that design into
something that runs on some hardware.  There are a lot of great cloud-based components, 
such as Azure, AWS, and Watson.  However, to build anything non-trivial, you need to open your favorite
code edit and say "File - New Project".  At that point, you can leverage all the highly scalable, highly
reliable components that the cloud has to offer. But. it is up to you to stitch them together, generally 
requiring lots of code, exception handling, security implementations, and so on.

IoT App Studio is different.  Rather than starting with code, you start by assembling and configuring 
pre-built components.  Then, if your solution requires it, you can do "File - New Project" and build the
things that are very specific to your implementation, plugging them in at one of the  many provided integration 
points.

Using this approach will dramatically shrink the time it takes to go from design to implementation, while
providing enough integration points to give you ultimate flexibility.

### _Configure More - Code Less_
