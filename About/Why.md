# Why IoT App Studio?

Building IoT Server and Edge applications is difficult and time consuming.  Usually this starts
with an idea or a set of requirements and potentially a design.  Eventually you need to turn that design into
something that runs on some hardware.  Although there are a lot of great cloud based components 
such as Azure, AWS, and Watson, to build anything non-trivial you need to open your favorite
code edit and say "File - New Project", at that point you can leverage all the highly scalable, highly
reliable compoments that the cloud has to offer, but it's up to you to stitch them together, generally 
with lots of code, exception handling, security implementations and so on.

IoT App Studio is different, rather than starting with code you start by assembling and configuring 
pre-built compoments, then if your solution requires it, you can do "File - New Project" and build the
things that are very specific to your implementation and plug them into one of the  many provided integration 
points.

Using this approach will dramatically shrink the time it takes to go from design to implementation while
providing enough integration points to provide ultimate flexibility.

### _Configure More - Code Less_
