# Credit Card Transactions

As with every part of our system, security is a top priority.  We build development tools for creating IoT applications, not 
credit card transaction processing software.  After your billing data is assembled into an invoice, we use [Stripe](https://www.stripe.com) 
to manage our invoicing and credit card transactions.  Your credit card data is never saved to our system.
