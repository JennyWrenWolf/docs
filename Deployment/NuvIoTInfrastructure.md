# NuvIoT Infrastructure

At Software Logistics, we know what we are good at.  We are extremely good at writing high quality, secure and scalable datadrive 
applications.  We also know that there are a lot of great companies out there that invested billions of dollars in 
cloud infrastructure.  Our run time engine and it's components are 100% built in containers so we can work with 
most cloud service providers.

We currently host our applications using the following cloud providers  
* [Digital Ocean](https://www.DigitalOcean.com)  
* [Microsoft Azure](https://www.WindowsAzure.com) 

And will be coming to AWS and IBM's Blue Mix in 2018
