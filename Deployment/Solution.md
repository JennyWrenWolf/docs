# Solution
NuvIoT is made up of a number of reusable components such as [listeners](../PipelineModules/Listener.md), 
[routes](../Routes/Route.md), [workflows](../Workflows/Index.md), [message](../Messaging/Index.md) as well as many more.

A solution is how you take all of those reusable components you have created and assemble them into an IoT Application.  Once you
have created your solution you will able able deploy an [instance](Instance.md) of it to a [host](Host.md).
