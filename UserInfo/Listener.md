# Listener


## Definition

A Listener is a module whose primary function is to “listen” for and identify [Messages](./Glossary/Message.md) being sent from a [Device](./Glossary/Device.md) to the Cloud.  Once the [Message](./Glossary/Message.md) is received, the Listener will pass the [Message](./Glossary/Message) on to a [Planner](./Glossary/Planner.md) which will determine what to do with it.
