# Pipeline Modules

## Definition
Pipeline Modules can be thought of as a very specific function, or logic, that is performed on a [Message](./Glossary/Message.md).  They are connected so that as one module completes its task, it hands the [Message](./Glossary/Message.md) off to the next module for execution.
