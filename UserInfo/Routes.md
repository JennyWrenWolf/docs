# Route


Routes identify how a [Message](./Glossary/Message.md) is processed when received in the Cloud.  They consist of a set of instructions such as 
- [Sentinels](./Glossary/Sentinel.md) 
- [Parsers](./Glossary/Parsers.md)
- [Workflows](./Glossary/Workflow.md) 
- [Business Logic](./Glossary/BusinessLogic.md).

Routes can also send messages back to the [Device](./Glossary/Device.md), to other systems, and/or write [Data](./Glossary/Data.md) to a [Data Stream](./Glossary/DataStream.md).
