# Messaging Parsing

## Definition

The NuvIoT Parsing tool takes a message and extracts items such as Device IDs, Message IDs, and values from the payload.

There are three important parts of defining how your messages are parsed and used, including:  
* **Key** - The key identifies this value as it is used to further process the message  
* **Search Location** - The listener populates different components that can be used to search for 
message values   
* **Storage Type** - This is the data type that is used to identify the data Storage Types
