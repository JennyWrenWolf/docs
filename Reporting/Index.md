# Reporting
The reporting module in NuvIoT allows provides a development environment where you can create reports that can either be generated on demand or from a recurring schedule.

The basic flow of creating reports is:
1.  Define your report
2.  Define your report parameters
3.  Upload a report revision
   
Once you have added your report, you can use the reporting portal to:
1.  Run the report on-demand
2.  Schedule the report
3.  View previously ran reports
