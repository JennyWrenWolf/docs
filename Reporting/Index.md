# Reporting
The reporting module in NuvIoT allows provides a development environment where you can create reports that can either be generated on demand or from a recurring schedule.

The basic flow of creating reports is:
1.  Define your report
2.  Define your report parameters
3.  Upload a report revision
   
Once you have added your report, you can use the reporting portal to:
1.  Run the report on-demand
2.  Schedule the report
3.  View previously ran reports

## Topics
1.  [Creating](PythonReport.md) a custom report in Python
2.  [Adding](AddingReport.md) the report to NuvIoT
3.  Getting [data](ReportData.md) from your devices
4.  [Specifying Parameters](Parameters.md) for your report
5.  [Running](RunningReport.md) your report
6.  [Scheduling](SchedulingReport.md) your report
