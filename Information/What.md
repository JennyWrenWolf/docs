# What


## IoT App Studio

IoT App Studio is a collection of online tools for configuring, deploying, managing and monitoring IoT Applications built on the NuvIoT Platform
## NuvIoT

NuvIoT (pronounced New-Vi-Ot) is a SaaS platform for rapidly building complete IoT Applications.  NuvIoT was built on top of the open source [LagoVista Devices, IoT and Home Automation Frameworks](https://github.com/lagovista)


## Lago Vista Devices, IoT and Home Automation Frameworks

The LagoVista Open Source Software Frameworks contains all the core components that NuvIoT was built on top of.  It also contains a set of libraries that are helpful when building both Server, Mobile, Device and IoT
software.

## Mobile Apps

There are three mobile apps that are part of the NuvIoT platform.  These applications are available on Windows, and coming soon to iOS and Android
       
* **Simulator** - A free Device Simulator that you can build and send custom messages via all the popular internet protocols that can be used to test NuvIoT server apps
* **Device Manager** - Used to provision monitor and interacct with Devices registered with the NuvIoT Platform
* **Platform Manager** - A simple tool to monitor and manaage your IoT Applications

These applications have also been relased as Open Source Software built on the Xamarin application frameworks 
and an SDK will be provided to quickly build your own custom white labeled apps for your customers
