Software Logistics was established by Kevin D. Wolf in 2001 as a high-end software consulting business. It has provided
consulting and development services for many prominent international companies, including Microsoft, Yahoo, Intel, IBM, Qualcomm, Flickr, and American Airlines, 
as well as a number of highly successful Tampa Bay-based companies.

For the first few years, Software Logistics focused on building web-based solutions with an RDMS back-end.  This included designing and
building a large decision support database and reporting portal for Field Operations at Nielsen Media Research as well as a
number of other ASP.NET web applications for companies in the Tampa Bay Area.

In 2005, the organization's focus shifted from web applications to line-of-business mobile apps.  At that time, the dominant player was
Pocket PC and Windows Mobile.  In early 2007, with the introduction of the iPhone and Android, Software Logistics retooled and
began developing applications for those platforms.  

In 2008, Kevin D. Wolf was awarded the prestigious Microsoft MVP designation for his work with Windows Mobile. According to Microsoft, "Microsoft MVPs are technology experts who passionately share their knowledge with the community. They are always on the 'bleeding edge' and have an unstoppable urge to get their hands on new, exciting technologies." This recognition is given to a very small number of programmers in the world. Since the initial award in 2008, Kevin D. Wolf has continued to receive this award annually.

In 2016, after a decade of building mobile apps, Software Logistics began to shift its focus to the Internet of Things (IoT).
Prior to starting Software Logistics, Kevin D. Wolf had developed hardware and software for embedded systems for Weigh-Tronix, so
transitioning back to controlling hardware with software was a natural fit.  After designing numerous microcontroller based
circuit boards, including the NiVek Quadcopter platform, Software Logistics started spending some time really understanding
what is involved with an IoT solution.

As with any software solution, there are many common components that make up an IoT application.  Software Logistics has a successful track record of building data-driven solutions.  As a natural transition, in the second half of 2016, work began on creating a design for
a secure, data-driven platform for building IoT applications where the focus is on configuration, not coding, but allows the right
set of integration points to add custom code as necessary.

Software Logistics plans to launch their NuvIoT platform with a limited set of beta customers in the fall of 2017, with general
availability planned for early 2018.
