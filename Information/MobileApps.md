# Mobile Apps

NuvIoT is a complete, end-to-end system. It allows you to capture and process data from sensors and devices.  *After all, without devices and sensors, you cannot have IoT.*

Although the is created by your devices and sensors, the real value comes in when that data is put to use.  In addition to providing online tools to manage and report on incoming data, we offer two paths for Mobile Apps.

### Standard Mobile Apps
  
If your IoT implementation is for internal use only, you may be able to use our standard IoT Device Manager app to manage, 
configure and monitor your provisioned devices.  Your specific device configurations will be reflected through our
data-driven mobile app user interface.

There are three mobile apps that are part of the NuvIoT platform.  These applications are available on Windows and coming soon to iOS and Android.  They include:

 * Simulator - A free Device Simulator that you can build to send custom messages via all the popular internet protocols that can be used to test NuvIoT server apps  
 * Device Manager - Used to provision monitor and interact with devices registered with the NuvIoT Platform  
 * Platform Manager - A simple tool to monitor and manaage your IoT Applications  

 ### White Label Mobile Apps
  
If you are offering up a product or service based on your IoT implementation, you may need product-specific branding as well as some custom features.  Our White Label mobile app SDK might be the right solution for you.

Our SDK provides Xamarin project templates that let you easily add in your company's logos as well as add additional functionality that leverages all the power of the NuvIoT platform to build incredible mobile apps that reflect your companies vision and strategy.
