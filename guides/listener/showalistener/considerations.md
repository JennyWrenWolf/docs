A listener is way to define ingress into your solution and define the attributes for that ingress.

Listeners are used to monitor a port, protocol or service for messages from your devices.  

**Listener (Tutorial)**

We will show you the minimum set up necessary to get a listener added to the system, as well as some of the more elaborate set up with more options enabled.

**_Recommendation:_**

_You will get better benefit from the tutorials, if you have a "manual" and/or other information of a sensor and/or actuator (devices) available.__
