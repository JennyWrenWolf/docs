### General comment about keys everywhere in the system.

The format of the key is 3-15 characters, all lowercase.
The key needs to be unique within the context (object table) of where it is used.
  
  For example: When asked to enter a key while adding a new "Device Repository" the context is the "Device Repository"

The key can be used later in the system for scripting to add additional functionaly to the system.
