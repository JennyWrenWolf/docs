### Device Type (Standard Documentation)

Without devices and sensors, you cannot have IoT.  At the heart of any IoT system, you will find devices and sensors.
Ideally, you will be able to find off-the-shelf hardware, but you may need to create custom hardware.  Either way, these 
devices and sensors will have attributes such as names, model numbers, etc.

You can add a Device Type to help describe groups of devices in your applications.  When you create your Device Type, you
will need to give it a name, key, and model number.  You can also add a manufacturer and other metadata about the Device Type.

Finally, you can add a default Device Configuration.  Device type is used
to provision new devices, the default Device Configuration is automatically filled in if it exists but can be overridden. 

### Device Type (Guide)

We will show you the minimum set up necessary to get a device message type added to the system, as well as some of the more elaborate set up with more options enabled.
