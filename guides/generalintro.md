This guide contains and will walk you through:

1. What they are
1. What they are used for
1. How to maintain them
    1. Add
    1. Edit
    1. Delete

**NOTE:  The Guide Tour steps should not be _used_ out of sequence (currently)**  
This has to do with the underlying demo DB and data reset abilities that we haven't created yet.
