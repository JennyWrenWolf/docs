Devices communicate with servers by sending and receiving messages. You should define all messages that you want your application to send and receive. As part of this, you will define the format that your message will use. Examples of formats include: JSON, XML, Binary, Delimited, etc.

### Sample Messages
Create samples of the messages to be used in both verifiers and simulators.  Define the fields that make up your messages as well as how those fields should be extracted or parsed.  As an optional step, create verifiers to check your parsers without even having your device send messages.  After you have created your messages, you can use them as a basis for building simulators to test out your system flow prior to bringing real devices online.

Messages can either be received from a device from a Listener or sent to a server or service from a Transmitter or both.
