**What is a Planner**

A planner is the way to find the device and message id's of the incoming messages.  
  
**What are Planners used for**

The Planner is responsible for using its Device-ID and Message-ID parsers for mapping the contents of a message for a particular device configuration to a route in order to perform additional processing.

**Planner (Tutorial)**

We will show you the minimum set up necessary to get a planner added to the system, as well as some of the more elaborate set up with more options enabled.

**_Recommendation:_**

_You will get better benefit from the tutorials , if you have a "manual" and/or other information of a sensor and/or actuator (devices) available._
