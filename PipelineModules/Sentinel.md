# Sentinel

Have a secure implementation should be a top priority of any IoT application.  NuvIoT provides a dedicated module to ensure the devices 
that are sending messages are indeed who they say they are, and if necessary they decrypt the message.

Message level security starts at the device and is completely dependent on it's capabilities and requirements. 

Getting security right is very important to us.  If you are reading this, you are an early adopter of our beta program, please contact us 
for a free consultation to discuss options that are available to ensure your messages are secure.xmd
