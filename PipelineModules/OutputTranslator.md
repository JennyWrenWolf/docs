# Output Translator

...more details coming soon....

The Output Translator is responsible for taking the data that was generated from the [Device Workflow](../Workflows/Index.md) and [Output Commands](../Workflows/OutputCommands.md)
and generate a message from an Outgoing Message Definition that will be forwarded to a [Transmitter](../PipelineModules/Transmitter.md) to be sent to an external server or service.

At this time there are two options available for Output Translators
* **Message Based** - Will use details provided in the [Output Message Definition](../Messaging/OutgoingMessages.md)
