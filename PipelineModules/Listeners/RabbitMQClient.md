# RabbitMQ Client

If you have your own RabbitMQ client that you wish to connect to, you can add a RabbitMQ Client Listener and connect to and subscribe
to topics/queues.  Our RabbitMQ client is currently in development.  Please [contact us](http://support.nuviot.com/contactus) if you need this functionality and we'll work with you to ensure a successful implmentation.
