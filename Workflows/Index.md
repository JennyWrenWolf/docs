# Workflow

Workflows allow you to provide custom logic that can be applied to your incoming messages.

* [Attributes](Attributes.md) - Properties that represent the current state of your device
* [Inputs](Input.md) - New values that arrive from incoming messages
* [Input Commands](InputCommands.md) - Commands that can be triggered from external sources to manipulate your device
* [Output Commands](OutputCommands.md) - Messages that are sent back to your device as a result of the workflow
* [State Machines](StateMachines.md) - In NuvIoT, [State Machines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite-state_machine) are a mechanism for building complex logic that can be executed based on the current state of your device 


### Mappings

A Visual Editor is provided to build your workflows.  You can add nodes and [Connect Them to Other Nodes](./Mappings/Index.md).  It should be noted that not 
all nodes can be connected to each other.
