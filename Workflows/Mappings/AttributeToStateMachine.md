# Attribute to State Machine

When Mapping an [Attribute](../Attributes.md) to a [State Machine](../StateMachines.md), you will need to 
select which event should be invoked when the attribute arrives.  The
State Machine transitions that handle the event will then receive the value of the attribute as an input.
