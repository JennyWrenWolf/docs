# Input to Attribute

If an [Input](../Input.md) is mapped to an [Attribute](../Attributes.md) the value contained
in the input will be applied and stored to the attribute so it can be accessed at a later time
or used within a report.  Inputs are temporary and will only exist while the message is being 
processsed.
