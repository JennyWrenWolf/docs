# Input Command to Attribute

If an [Input Command](../InputCommands.md) is mapped to an [Attribute](../Attributes.md) the value or values
that are passed in from the Input Command are set on the Attribute.  These are set via mappings.  As the 
attribute is set, the Attribute OnSet script is executed.
