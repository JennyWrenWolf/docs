# Device Workflows

Getting and storing device data is an important part of what IoT App Studio lets you do, but the real
value is doing something with data.  You can use a Graphical user interface to map processes and check conditions using the 
data contained in messages from your device.  Workflows have things like Inputs, Attributes, Actions, State Machines and Output 
Commands to send data back to your device.  Workflows are reusable compoments that you can use in many different device
configurations.
