# Simulator - Open Source

When we started to build NuvIoT we searched for a good general purpose device simulator that we could use to help build and test our system.  We didnt' find any
that met our needs so we decided to build our own.

We decided to offer up our simulator as a free app on the Windows Store for the Desktop and Windows Phone applications and by the end of the year we will have 
this published for both iOS and Android as well.

Our application was built with a number of [Nuget Packages](https://www.nuget.org/packages?q=lagovista.) that make up the the LagoVista Devices, IoT and Home Automation Frameworks.  The simulator
was built with the Xamarin Frameworks using Xamarin Forms and the full source code is availabe on [github](https://github.com/lagovista/simulator).
