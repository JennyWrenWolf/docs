## Example

Mr. Lederer owns the boat *Everglades* which is connected to the Internet of Things.  There are three other boats in his fleet, *Alcatraza, Bermuda, and Costa Rica*.   Each of these boats are also connected to the Internet of Things.  Altogether, Mr. Lederer owns four Devices and is very, very rich.

Plymouth Manufacturing owns a conveyor belt that is equipped with a heat sensor and is able to stop production if the belt overheats.  It can do this because it has been connected to the Cloud through the Internet of Things.  The conveyor belt is referred to as a Device.
