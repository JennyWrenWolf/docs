# Sensor

## Definition
A Sensor is a small piece of computer equipment that acts as peoples five senses do.  Through our senses, we can see, hear, smell, feel and taste.  A sensor allows the device to do the same.  Depending on what type of sensor is chosen, it can feel temperatures or measure the level of a toxin in the air.  It can see movement or hear voices.  The sensor allows the device to take in information about the current conditions.
