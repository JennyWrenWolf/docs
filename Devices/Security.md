# Device Security

Although we have recommendations and built in capabilities, we understand that your devices will have different security needs.  We 
look forward to working with you to understand those needs and ensure that our system can provide a robust mechanism to authenticate and
authorize your devices.  We offer may ways to get your data into our system to include everything from MQTT and REST using simple user name/password
combinations to using [Azure IoT Hub](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/iot-hub/iot-hub-devguide-security) as a proxy to ensure a completely 
secure solution.
