# Firmware

## Definition

Firmware is a type of software that operates on the Control Board.  Its like a very simple computer that  needs to be configured to identify and process incoming and outgoing information.  

NuvIoT offers Control Boards that contain utilities and software libraries that help set up Firmware.  Other hardware options may also be used.  However, they will require independent knowledge about the tools and possibly additional custom software.

## Example

A temperature sensor on the motor of the conveyor belt took a reading of 180 degrees.  The conveyor belt's firmware received that value and used it to build and send a message to the Cloud.
