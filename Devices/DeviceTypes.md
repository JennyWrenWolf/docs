# Device Types

## Definition

The Device Type is a piece of hardware that contains a unique set of sensors, actuators, and control boards whose data is processed in a specific manner. The Device Type identifies what Device is sending a message.  When NuvIoT receives the message, it can process it in a manner specific to that Device.
