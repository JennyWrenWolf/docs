<h1>Output Commands</h1>
<p>...more details coming soon...</p>
<p>Output Commands are used to send a message back to your device.  When creating an output command you select a <a href="../Messaging/Index.md">Message
Definition</a> that contains the fields that make up your outgoing message.  You will then be required
to map fields that are either available from the incoming message or the device.</p>
<p>The message is then passed to the <a href="#/pipelinemodules/outputtranslator">Output Translator</a> that will convert it to the native format your device will understand prior to passing it to the
<a href="#/pipelinemodules/transmitter">Transmitter</a> that will eventually ensure your device receives the message.</p>
<h3>Scripting</h3>
<p>To work with output commands you will use simple scripts.  To create an output command, you will use the <a href="#/scripting/invokeoutputcommand">send command</a> in any script.  To build the content of the output command
you will create a function called <a href="#/scripting/outputcommandcreate">onExecute</a>.</p>
<h3>Mappings from Output Commands</h3>
<p>None - An Output Command can only have incoming connections.</p>
