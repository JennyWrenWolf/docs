<h1>Input to Attribute</h1>
<p>If an <a href="#/workflows/input">Input</a> is mapped to an <a href="#/workflows/attributes">Attribute</a>, the value contained
in the Input will be applied and stored to the Attribute so that it can be accessed at a later time
or used within a report.  Inputs are temporary and will only exist while the message is being
processsed.</p>
<p>When mapping an Input to an Attribute, the types must be the same.  In addition, if the type is a
<a href="#/messaging/typesystem/valuewithunits">Value with Unit</a>  or <a href="#/messaging/typesystem/statesandenums">State Set</a>,
the Values and State Sets must match between the source and destination.</p>
<p>When the Attribute is set on the workflow, a <a href="#/scripting/attributeonset">Script</a> can be provided to run custom logic.</p>
