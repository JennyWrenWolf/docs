<h3>General comment about keys everywhere in the system.</h3>
<p>The format of the key is 3-15 characters, all lowercase.
The key needs to be unique within the context (object table) of where it is used.</p>
<p>For example: When asked to enter a key while adding a new &quot;Device Repository&quot; the context is the &quot;Device Repository&quot;</p>
<p>The key can be used later in the system for scripting to add additional functionaly to the system.</p>
