<h1>Pipeline Modules</h1>
<p>To allow for maximum reuse and scalability, build your application as a set of Pipeline Modules.  Once the <a href="#/pipelinemodules/listener">Listener</a>
receives a message that is handed off to the <a href="#/pipelinemodules/planner">Planner</a> to determine processing, a <a href="#/routes/route">Route</a> is created.</p>
<p>A route is a series of Pipeline Modules that are executed sequentially to perform processing on incoming messages.</p>
<p>The following are the default Pipeline Modules that make up a typical route:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#/pipelinemodules/sentinel">Sentinel</a> - Authenticates and potentially decrypts the message</li>
<li><a href="#/pipelinemodules/inputtranslator">Input Translator</a> - Extracts values from the input message</li>
<li><a href="#/pipelinemodules/workflow">Workflow</a> - Performs any business logic and prepares output messages</li>
<li><a href="#/pipelinemodules/outputtranslator">Output Translator</a> - Converts outputs from the workflow back into a format that the device can understand</li>
<li><a href="#/pipelinemodules/transmitter">Transmitter</a> - Sends values back to the device, either directly or by queueing them</li>
</ul>
<p>Most of the time, message business logic is done in the <a href="#/pipelinemodules/workflow">Workflow Module</a>.  The workflow allows for a significant amount
of customization in the form of scripting and creating <a href="#/workflows/statemachines">State Machines</a>.  If these don't meet
your needs, you can always create Pipeline Modules with custom code and deploy them as containers to participate in the device workflow.</p>
