<h1>Data Streams</h1>
<p>Data streams are powerful building blocks that allow you to get the system from your devices into other storage devices so it can be used for analtyics or reporting.  Some storage machisms are one way in that they can only write data to be processed by other systems.
Others can be used to supply data for our IoT Dashboard for charting and reporting</p>
