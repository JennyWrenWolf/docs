# Opening a Platform IO Project

>It is possible to have more than one PlatformIO Project open at a time.   Itâ€™s also possible to have a project open yet Platform IO is not seeing it as your project, therefore, your ESP-Prog wil not work.

>Since we are using Visual Studio Code, I would share the screen shots of opening the workspace file that allows you to see all the projects contained within the overall solution and make sure that Platform IO is able to use the ESP-Prog.
