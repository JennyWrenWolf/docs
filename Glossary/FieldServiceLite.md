# Field Service Lite
## Definition
NuvIoT provides a program called *Field Service Lite*.  It offers basic implementation for core features of a typical Field Service Application and was designed to be integrated with a preexisting Application. 

*Field Service Lite* is able to create a [Service Ticket](./ServiceTicket.md) and organize it into [Service Boards](./ServiceBoard.md)whenever a [Device](./Device.md) generates an error.  The [Service Tickets](./ServiceTickets.md) are directed to an individual or a group, providing information about the problem.

## Example
The *Plymouth IoT Conveyor Belt* reached a temperature of 425Â°, creating an `overheat` [Error Code](./ErrorCode.md).  This generated a [Service Ticket](./ServiceTicket.md) in *Field Service Lite* and posted a [Notification](./Notification.md) on the floor manager's [Service Board](./ServiceBoard.md).
