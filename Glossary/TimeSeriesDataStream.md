Notes:  Example is from Data Stream - if this is based on time isn't it a better example here?  Each data point must have a time stamp.  Analysize based on the time stamps.  Time Bucket (a period of time where data is grouped for analysis)

# Time Series Data Stream
## Definition
Time-Series Data Streams are an optimized storage technology that is very powerful for understanding the behavior of IoT devices over a period of time. 

How many times an event took place over a period of time.  How many different events took place over a period of time.  The Average temperature over a period of time.

## Example
Temperatures of the *Plymouth IoT Conveyor Belt* were saved as Data Streams.  Every time a bearings' temperature was sent from the [Device](./Device.md) to the [Cloud](./Cloud.md), it was saved in a special format that allowed the engineer to look at what temperatures were produced over a period of time.
