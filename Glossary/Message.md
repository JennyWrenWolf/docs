# Message


## Definition
IoT is all about [Devices](./Glossary/Device.md) and the [Cloud](Glossary/Cloud.md) communicating.  These conversations are made up of Messages that share data and initiate actions. They generally consist of three parts:

- [Device ID](./Glossary/DeviceID.md) - which specific [Device](./Glossary/Device.md) sent the message
- [Message ID](./Glossary/MessageID.md) - what type of message is being sent
- [Payload](./Glossary/Payload.md) - the data or value being sent

Message formats are defined in the [Studio](./Glossary/Studio.md) as reusable objects.  This means that a single Message format may be used in a variety of [Solutions](./Glossary/Solution.md).

## Example

The bearings' in the *Plymouth Iot Conveyor Belt* began to overheat so it sent a message to the [Cloud](./Glossary/Cloud.md).  The Message contained the [Device ID](./Glossary/DeviceID.md) (PICBelt0012), the [Message ID](./Glossary/MessageID.md) (overheat), and a [Payload](./Glossary/Payload.md) (435Â°).
