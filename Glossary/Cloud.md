# Cloud
## Definition

The Cloud is made up of individual servers (think computers) around the globe that are connected to each other. The servers/computers are designed to do tasks and then work together to allow access anytime and anywhere.  The Cloud can store and process data, produce reports or initiate actions.  

Although the Cloud is often where IoT is processed, sometimes IoT processing takes place on a local server.  The local server is called [IoT Edge](./Glossary/IoTEdge.md).

## Example

The security system at *Plymouth Manufacturing* consists of a motion sensor and security camera.  The motion sensor detects if there is activity in the office.  If there is, the sensor sends a [Message](./Glossary/Message.md) to the Cloud which is programmed to send a [Message](./Glossary/Message.md) to the security camera, instructing it to begin filming.  The Cloud also is programmed to send an alert to the owner.
