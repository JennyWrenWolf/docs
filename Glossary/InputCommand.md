# Input Command
## Definition
Input Commands can be used to trigger processes and actions on a specific [Device's](./Glossary/Device.md) [Workflow](./Glossary/Workflow.md).  This can be setting a value, sending [Messages](./Glossary/Message.md), generating [Output Commands](Glossary/OutputCommand.md) or sending events to a [State Machine](./Glossary/StateMachine.md).  Input Commands are exposed as a [REST API](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer).

## Example
The roller on the *Plymouth IoT Conveyor Belt* became jammed.  The company engineer wanted to reset the CB to see if they could get it running again so they used a custom application written by one of their software engineers that called the input command with its REST API.
