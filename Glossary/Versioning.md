# Versioning 
## Definition
[Solutions](./Glossary/Solution.md) can be saved at any point as a version. This has two benefits:
- When a [Solution](.Glossary/Solution.md) is based off a specific Version, updates and changes made behind the scenes.  The working [Deployment Instance](./Glossary/DeploymentInstance.md) will continue to operate and only be updated by the new version when bugs are removed and changes are fully tested. 
- In addition, if an update is published and a bug is found within it, it will be possible to rollback to a previous version of the [Solution](./Glossary/Solution.md) that doesnâ€™t have the problem.

## Example
Shortly after updating the [Solution](./Glossary/Solution.md) for their conveyor belt, *Plymouth Manufacturing* discovered a problem in capturing data.  They contacted NuvIoT and had them revert back to the last version of [Solution](./Glossary/Solution.md) which did not have the glitch.
