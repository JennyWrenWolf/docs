# Output Command
## Definition
Just as [Input Commands](./Glossary/InputCommand.md) provide a way to map values from incoming [Messages](./Glossary/Message.md) into a [Workflow](./Glossary/Workflow.md), Output Commands are used to provide outputs or trigger events that can either be sent to back to the [Device](./Glossary/Device.md) or to other systems.  A single [Workflow](./Glossary/Workflow.md) can have multiple Output Commands.  Each of these Output Commands will need to be [Mapped](./Glossary/Mapping.md) to a [Message](./Glossary/Message.md).
