# Dashboard

## Definition

A Dashboard is a user-operated computer display.  It consists of [Apps](./Apps.md) and [Widgets](./Widget.md) that display charts, data and tables using values from a [Device](./Device.md).  The Dashboard provides valuable feedback to the users and allows them to interact with their [Devices](./Device.md).

## Example

The operating engineer at *Plymouth Manufacturing* checked the Dashboard which showed how all of their IoT [Devices](./Device.md) were working.  It showed that over the last week, the bearings' temperature of the *Plymouth IoT Conveyor Belt* ranged from 97-140Â°, falling within limits. The [Widget](./Widget.md) also showed the all eight of their belts were properly functioning.
