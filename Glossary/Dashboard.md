# Dashboard

## Definition

A Dashboard is a user-operated computer display.  It consists of [Apps](./Glossary/Apps.md) that may display charts, data and tables using values from a [Device](./Glossary/Device.md).  The Dashboard provides valuable feedback to the users and allows them to interact with their [Devices](./Glossary/Device.md).

## Example

The operating engineer at *Plymouth Manufacturing* was asked to check the Dashboard which showed how all of their IoT [Devices](./Glossary/Device.md) were working.  It showed that over the last week, the bearings' temperature of the *Plymouth IoT Conveyor Belt* ranged from 97-140Â°, falling within limits.  She also was able to see that the security system in the main office was functioning properly.
