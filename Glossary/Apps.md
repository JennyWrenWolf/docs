# Apps

## Definition
Building an IoT system will generate data which is collected in NuvIoT.  This data is made available by creating Apps with minimal programming and displayed on the [Dashboard](./Glossary/Dashboard.md).  Apps may also be used to configure different parts of the [Deployment Instance](./Glossary/DeploymentInstance.md).
