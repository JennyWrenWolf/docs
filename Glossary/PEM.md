# Pipeline Execution Message/PEM
## Definition
A Pipeline Execution Message, or PEM, is an object that contains the information that was sent from the [Device](./Glossary/Device.md) to the [Cloud](./Glossary/Cloud.md).  In addition, the [Planner](./Gossary/Planner.md) adds data to the PEM that is necessary to process it in the [Pipeline Modules](./Glossary/PipelineModule.md).  The PEM is handed off to a [Route](./Glossary/Route.md) which contains the appropriate [Pipeline Module](./Glossary/PipelineModule.md).

## Example
A [Message](./Glossary/Message.md) containing a bearing temperature of 350Â° is sent from the *Plymouth IoT Conveyor Belt* to the [Cloud](./Glossary/Cloud.md).  The [Planner](./Glossary/Planner.md) identifies the [Device ID](./Glossary/DeviceID.md) and [Message ID](./Glossary/MessageID.md), and with this information locates the [Route](./Glossary/Routes.md) that will process the data.  It also populates the PEM with the [Pipeline Modules](./Glossary/PipelineModule.md) that have the steps necessary to shut down the conveyor belt and notify the shop owner.
