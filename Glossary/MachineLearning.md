# Machine Learning
## Definition
Machine Learning allows NuvIoT to analyse data coming from a [Device](./Device.md) and look for patterns, thereby providing the ability to detect anomalies.

## Example
After collecting belt vibration data from a *Plymouth Iot Conveyor Belt*, the data scientists were able to produce a Machine Learning model.  The model used uploaded monitor vibration data from a running belt to look for anomalies.  After using this model for only two weeks, they were able to detect an abnormal vibration from one of their primary belts and fix it by simply changing the lubricant.  This Machine Learning model saved them from lots of down time.
