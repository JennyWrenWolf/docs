## Example

The employees at *Plymouth Manufacturing* cheered when *NuvIoT* published the [Deployment Instance](./Glossary/DeploymentInstance.md) for their factory floor full of *Plymouth IoT Conveyor Belts* and security systems.  Now the belts are connected by IoT which will monitor their bearing' temperatures and address overheating problems.
