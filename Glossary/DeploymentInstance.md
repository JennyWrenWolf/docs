# Deployment Instance 
## Definition
A Deployment Instance is a deployed, or published, version of a [Solution](./Glossary/Solution.md).   When the Deployment Instance begins functioning, the [Device](./Glossary/Device.md) and the [Cloud](./Glossary/Cloud.md) begin to communicate.

## Example
The employees at *Plymouth Manufacturing* cheered when *NuvIoT* published the [Deployment Instance](./Glossary/DeploymentInstance.md) for their factory floor full of *Plymouth IoT Conveyor Belts* and security systems.  Now the belts are connected by IoT which will monitor their bearing' temperatures and address overheating problems.
