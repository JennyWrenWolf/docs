## Example
*Plymouth Manufacturing* decided to upgrade their security system by catching activity on video for one minute every hour.  They were able to add a Device Specific Setting to their [Device](./Glossary/Device.md) to film every hour versus the programmed "Triggered by Motion" setting.
 upgraded their security system by recording video based on their location. In some high-traffic locations, they wanted to only record 15 seconds of video when motion is detected, where as in high risk areas they wanted to record 2 minutes. They were able to create and configure this setting as a property on the device .
