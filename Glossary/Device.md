## Example

*Plymouth Manufacturing* owns a conveyor belt that is equipped with heat sensors that measure the temperature of its bearings.  These temperatures are sent to the [Cloud](./Glossary/Cloud.md) which can trigger a [Message](./Glossary/Message.md) to stop the belt if the bearings overheat.  They also own two IoT Security Devices in their main office. When the motion sensor is triggered, it causes the video camera to begin recording.  The motion sensor also notifies the owner of activity.
