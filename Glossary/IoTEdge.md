# IoT Edge
## Definition
 
[Deployment Instances](./DeploymentInstance.md) are typically deployed in the [Cloud](./Cloud.md), which means they operate and store information on remote servers.  An IoT Edge deployment allows the [Instance](./DeploymentInstance.md) to be deployed locally.

## Example
*Plymouth Manufacturing* PL MFG wanted to use Machine Learning to analize vibration data from their conveyor belts. To do so they needed to gather lots of samples at a very fast sample rate. They choose to operate their [Deployment Instance](./DeploymentInstance.md) on site so they used an IoT Edge deployment.

For applications that need to send lots of data with a fast sample rate, it may not be feasible to send that over the internet so they chose in IoT edge solution.
