# IoT Edge

## Definition
 
[Deployment Instances](./Glossary/DeploymentInstance.md) are typically deployed in the [Cloud](./Glossary/Cloud.md), which means they operate and store information on remote servers.  An IoT Edge deployment allows the [Instance](./Glossary/DeploymentInstance.md) to be deployed locally.

## Example

*Plymouth Manufacturing* is a small company with only four office staff and one conveyor belt.  They choose to operate their [Deployment Instance](./Glossary/DeploymentInstance.md) on site so they used an IoT Edge deployment.
