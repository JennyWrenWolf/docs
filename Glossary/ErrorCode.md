# Error Code
## Definition
Common failures that occur on a [Device](./Glossary/Device.md) may be assigned an Error Code which can help diagnose and fix problems. Error codes may be generated by 

- the [Device Configuration](./Glossary/DeviceConfiguration.md) after receiving specific [Messages](./Glossary/Message.md)
- a [Watch Dog](./Glossary/WatchDog.md) that does not receive a [Message](./Glossary/Message.md) in a predefined period of time
- or if [Business Logic Script](./Glossary/BusinessLogic.md) returns False

An Error Code may be used to generate an error on the [Device](./Glossary/Device.md) and perform necessary steps which may include sending a notification to a distribution list.   


Optionally, NuvIoT has a very basic [Field Service](./Glossary/FieldServiceLite.md) implementation called [Field Service Lite](./Glossary/FieldServiceLite.md).  Error Codes may generate [Service Tickets](./Glossary/ServiceTicket.md) which are then managed by this service.

## Example

The *Plymouth IoT Conveyor Belt* sent a [Message](./Glossary/Message.md) to the [Cloud](./Glossary/Cloud.md) with a bearing temperature of 750Â°.  The [Business Logic Script](./Glossary/BusinessLogic.md) generated False and triggered an Error Code which sent a notification to the company owner and returned a [Message](./Glossary/Message.md) to stop the [Device](./Glossary/Device.md).  No further [Messages](./Glossary/Message.md) were received by the [Message Watch Dog](./Glossary/WatchDog.md) which once again triggered an Error Code and notification to the owner.
