# Error Code
## Definition
Common failures that occur on a [Device](./Glossary/Device.md) may be assigned an Error Code on a [Device Configuration](./Glossary/DeviceConfiguration.md) which can help diagnose and fix problems. Error codes may be generated by 

- the [Device](./Glossary/Device.md) after receiving a specific [Message](./Glossary/Message.md)
- a [Watch Dog](./Glossary/WatchDog.md) that does not receive a [Message](./Glossary/Message.md) in a predefined period of time
- or if [Business Logic](./Glossary/BusinessLogic.md) determines there is an error and returns False

An Error Code may be used to perform necessary steps to address the problem which may include sending a notification to a [Distribution List](./Glossary/DistributionList.md).


Optionally, NuvIoT has a very basic [Field Service](./Glossary/FieldServiceLite.md) implementation called [Field Service Lite](./Glossary/FieldServiceLite.md).  Error Codes may generate [Service Tickets](./Glossary/ServiceTicket.md) which are then managed by this module.

## Example
The *Plymouth IoT Conveyor Belt* sent a [Message](./Glossary/Message.md) to the [Cloud](./Glossary/Cloud.md) with a bearing temperature of 750Â°.  The [Business Logic](./Glossary/BusinessLogic.md) determined this was out of range and triggered an Error Code which sent a notification to the company owner and returned a [Message](./Glossary/Message.md) to stop the [Device](./Glossary/Device.md).  No further [Messages](./Glossary/Message.md) were received by the [Message Watch Dog](./Glossary/WatchDog.md) which once again triggered an Error Code and notification to the owner.
