# Device ID
## Definition
Each [Device](./Glossary/Device.md) that is provisioned within a [Device Repository](./Glossary/DeviceRepository.md) will have a unique Device ID.  This is a set of letters and/or numbers that will be used to identify each individual [Device](./Glossary/Device.md). Although itâ€™s not necessary, it may be helpful to include something that identifies the [Device Model](./Glossary/DeviceModel.md) in the Device ID along with a sequential number.

## Example
The *Plymouth IoT Conveyor Belt* sends a [Message](./Glossary/Message.md) to the [Cloud](./Glossary/Cloud.md) with its Device ID PICBelt0012.  The [Cloud](./Glossary/Cloud.md) uses the Device ID to identify that the [Message](./Glossary/Message.md) came from *Plymouth Manufacturing's* belt and sends the [Message](./Glossary/Message.md) to the appropriate [Device Configuration](./Glossary/DeviceConfiguration.md).
