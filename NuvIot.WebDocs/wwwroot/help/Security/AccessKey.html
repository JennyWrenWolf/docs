<h1>Access Key Authorization</h1>
<p>Although not very secure without <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security">Transport Layer Security</a> (TLS),
a simple method to authorize your device is to look for either the primary or secondary Access Keys as
<a href="#/security/securityfields">Security Fields</a> within your message.</p>
<p>The keys must be sent in plain text. Use the <a href="#/security/locatingsecurityfield">Security Field Locator</a> to find them.</p>
<p>To implement Access Key Authorization, use the generated Base64 keys as part of adding a device.  You can also add your own
custom access keys.</p>
