<h1>Credit Card Transactions</h1>
<p>As with every part of our system, security is a top priority.  We build development tools for creating IoT applications, not
credit card transaction processing software.  After your billing data is assembled into an invoice, we use <a href="https://www.stripe.com">Stripe</a>
to manage our invoicing and credit card transactions.  Your credit card data is never saved to our system.</p>
