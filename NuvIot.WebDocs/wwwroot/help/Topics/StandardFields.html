<h1>Standard Fields</h1>
<p>IoT App Studio is a tool to create configurations that make up applications that will run in NuvIoT.  This means you will be entering a lot of data.</p>
<p>Almost all forms that you create will require a minimum of two required fields and one optional field.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Name</strong> (required) - This is a textual description that can be used to help you identify the item you are work working with.</li>
<li><strong>Key</strong> (required) - This is an identifier that will be used internally the NuvIoT run time to identify components.  See <a href="#/topics/keys">Keys</a> for more details.</li>
<li><strong>Description</strong> - Description is a simple text field that can be used to add documentation to your object.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Name</strong>'s are user editable and can be changed at any time.  Currently if you are referencing a component and change the name of the original component the name in the reference may not be changed.  This will be address early in 2018</p>
<p><strong>Keys</strong>'s are only user editable when first created, but can not be edited.</p>
