<h1>Standard Fields</h1>
<p>IoT App Studio is a tool used to create configurations that make up applications that will run in NuvIoT.  This means that you will be entering a lot of data.</p>
<p>Almost all forms that you create will require a minimum of two required fields and one optional field as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Name</strong> (required) - This is a textual description that can be used to help identify the item.<br />
Names are user editable and can be changed at any time.  Currently, if you are referencing a component and change the name of the original component, the name in the reference may not be changed.  This will be addressed early in 2018.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Key</strong> (required) - This is an identifier that will be used internally by the NuvIoT runtime to identify components.  See <a href="#/topics/keys">Keys</a> for more details.<br />
Keys can only be edited by the user when first created.  After that, they cannot be edited.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Description</strong> - Description is a simple text field that can be used to add documentation to your object.</p>
</li>
</ol>
