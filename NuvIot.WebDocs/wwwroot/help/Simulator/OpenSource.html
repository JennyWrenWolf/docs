<h1>Simulator - Open Source</h1>
<p>When we started to build NuvIoT, we searched for a good, general-purpose device simulator that we could use to help build and test our system.  We did not find any
that met our needs, so we decided to build our own.</p>
<p>We decided to offer up our simulator as a free app on the Windows Store for Desktop and Windows Phone applications. By the end of the year, we will have
this published for both iOS and Android as well.</p>
<p>The simulator is not specific to NuvIoT. You will need to create a a NuvIoT account. This will allow you to store simulator definitions for free on our server as well as access them from any machine.</p>
<p>Our application was built with a number of <a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages?q=lagovista.">Nuget Packages</a> that make up the the LagoVista Devices, IoT and Home Automation Frameworks.  The simulator
was built with the Xamarin Frameworks using Xamarin Forms.  The full source code is available on <a href="https://github.com/lagovista/simulator">Github</a>.</p>
