<h1>Device Messaging</h1>
<p>Devices communicate with the servers by sending and receiving Messages.  You should define all messages
that you want your application to send and receive.  As part of this, you will define the format that your message will use,
examples of this are things like JSON, XML, Binary, Delimited and so on.  Next you'll define the fields that make up your messages
as well as how those fields should be extracted or parsed.  You can even create Verifiers to check your parsers without even having
your device send messages.</p>
