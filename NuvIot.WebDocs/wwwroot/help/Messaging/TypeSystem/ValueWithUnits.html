<h1>Value with Units</h1>
<p>Although numeric values exist by themselves, in some cases they may have units associated with them.  The classic example for many systems is that of temperature.  When you define
your units you define a default value, and conversion factors.</p>
<p>When defining a Unit Set, you can (but do not have to) define multiple units.  Of thosee multiple units you specify exactly one unit as the default unit. Then for the other units
you have the option to provide a simple scaling factor that can be applied to convert that unit to and from the default unit set or you can provide some simple JSON scripts that
will do the conversion.</p>
<p>In addition you can also provide the number of decimal points of precision for each unit.</p>
