<h1>Parsing a Binary Message</h1>
<h2>Intro</h2>
<p>Parsing a binary message is fairly complex but there are many options to specify how values should be extracted from the binary message payload.</p>
<h2>Endiness</h2>
<p>The device may produce data in either <a href="#https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endianness#Little">Little Endian</a> or <a href="#https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endianness#Big">Big Endian</a>.  Unless the firmware of your device is customizable this will be dictated by the device.  This is set at the device level since the device will send all its values in one format or the other and not mixed.</p>
<h2>Data Types Available</h2>
<p>The following are the available data types that can be extracted from a binary message</p>
<ul>
<li>char - Big or Little Endian</li>
<li>byte - Big or Little Endian</li>
<li>Int16 - Big or Little Endian</li>
<li>UInt16 - Big or Little Endian</li>
<li>Int32 - Big or Little Endian</li>
<li>UInt32 - Big or Little Endian</li>
<li>Int64 - Big or Little Endian</li>
<li>UInt64 - Big or Little Endian</li>
<li>Boolean - 0 = False, Not 0 = true</li>
<li>String (<a href="#/Messaging/Parsing/#Parsing-String-Values">configurable</a>)</li>
<li>Single Precision Floating Point as defined by by <a href="#https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_754-1985">IEEE 754-1985</a></li>
<li>Double Precision Floating Point as defined by by <a href="#https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_754-1985">IEEE 754-1985</a></li>
</ul>
<h2>Framing Bytes</h2>
<p><a href="#/Messaging/Parsing/FramingBytes.md">Framing Bytes</a> can be used to confirm the validity of your message as well as provide checkpoints for relative parsing of your message.</p>
<h2>Binary Offset</h2>
<p>Enter the Absolute Offset or Relative offset within the message to extract the value.  The data type will determine how many bytes will be read.  If you attempt to read past the end of the message, the parser will fail.</p>
<p><em>NOTE</em> In this case the index or binary offset is 0 based which is different than parsing delimited values where the index of the delimited value is</p>
<h3>Absolute</h3>
<p>This is used if your message is always the same size and the expected values are always in the same position.</p>
<h3>Relative</h3>
<p>This is used if your message size is different based on the type of message, this is generally the case when there are string included or content depends on values parsed earlier in the message.
(Currently only fixed length message are supported, this will likely be changed prior to launch)</p>
<h2>Parsing String Values</h2>
<p>At this time only single byte ASCII text is supported Unicode characters are not supported.</p>
<p>There are two ways extracting strings are supported in binary messages, null terminated prefixing the string by the string length.  If your string is null terminated the parser will start looking for the string at the defined index and start reading characters until either the null (0x00) terminated is found or you reach the end of the message.</p>
<p>If the string length is prefixed to the string you need to set the following options</p>
<ul>
<li>Number of Bytes - You need to specify how many bytes are used to define the string length.  Currently 1, 2 and 4 are supported.</li>
<li>Endiness - (will be inheritied from the message if applicable, but need to specify if you are searching for Message or Device Ids</li>
</ul>
