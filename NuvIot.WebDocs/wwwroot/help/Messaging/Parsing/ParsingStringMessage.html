<h1>Parsing a String Message</h1>
<p>There are two options for parsing a pure String Message.  One is with <a href="ParsingWithRegEx.md">regular
expressions</a>, the second is by using <a href="#/messaging/parsing/parsingtextmessages">positional attributes</a>.</p>
<p>For your message, select the Content Type <strong>String with Position</strong> and provide a
start index and a length in order to extract the field from the string content.  If your message uses delimiters,
there is a <a href="#/messaging/parsing/parsingdelimitedmessage">Parsing Strategy</a> that will work better for you.</p>
<p>When entering the Start Index, use 1 as the starting point. That is to say, if you want to
capture the first character as part of your string, you will use 1 as the Start Index.</p>
