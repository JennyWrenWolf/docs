<h1>Parsing a String Message</h1>
<p>There are two options for parsing a pure string message.  One is with regular
expressions, the second is by using positional attributes.</p>
<p>For your message, select the content type <strong>String with Position</strong> and provide a
start index and a length in order to extract the field from the string content.  If your message uses delimiters,
there is a <a href="#/Messaging/Parsing/ParsingDelimitedMessage.md">Parsing Strategy</a> that will work better for you.</p>
<p>When entering the start index, use 1 as the starting point. That is to say, if you want to
capture the first character as part of your string, you will use 1 as the start index.</p>
