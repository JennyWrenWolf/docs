<h1>Design Philosophy</h1>
<p>Our Design Philosophy is based on a pragmatic approach to building software that focuses on quickly implementing requirements in a
system that will stand the test of time, both in terms of scalability and flexibility.</p>
<p>Here are a number of axioms that we adopted when designing NuvIot:</p>
<ol>
<li>Currently, building <strong>real IoT applications</strong> is hard, requiring very <strong>specialized talents.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Security</strong> needs to start with the <strong>infrastructure</strong>, it cannot be added on at a later time.</li>
<li><strong>Scalability</strong> can be achieved by <strong>breaking the problem</strong> into separate, <strong>independent processing steps.</strong></li>
<li><strong>High Availability</strong> should be as simple as <strong>selecting a configuration.</strong></li>
<li>There are a number of <strong>similar building blocks</strong> in every IoT application.</li>
<li>Each IoT application is a collection of <strong>building blocks</strong>, or <strong>microservices.</strong></li>
<li>With the right level of <strong>abstraction</strong>, <strong>similar building blocks</strong> can be tailored via configuration rather than <em>coding</em>.</li>
<li>The majority of an IoT application can be <strong>assembled</strong> by connecting <strong>configured building blocks, or microservices.</strong></li>
<li>It is <strong>impossible</strong> to 100% configure <strong>every requirement</strong> in a non-trivial system.</li>
<li><strong>Integration Points</strong> should be provided to seamlessly add both <strong>scripts</strong> and <strong>custom code.</strong></li>
<li>Adding <strong>custom code</strong> should allow developers to focus <strong>only</strong> on their specific needs, <strong>not infrastructure.</strong></li>
<li>Just because something <strong>is not hard</strong> does not mean it is not <strong>industrial grade.</strong></li>
</ol>
