<h1>Software Logistics</h1>
<p>Software Logistics was established by Kevin D. Wolf in 2001 as a high-end software consulting business. It's provided
consulting andn devleopment services for companies such as Microsoft, Yahoo, Intel, IBM, Qualcomm, Flickr, American Airlines
as well as number of highly successful companies in the Tampa Bay area.</p>
<p>For the first few years, Software Logistics focused on building web based solutions with a RDMS backend.  This included designing and
building a large decisions support database and reporting portal for Field Operations at Nielsen Media Research as well as a
number of other ASP.NET web applications for companies in the Tampa Bay Area.</p>
<p>Around 2005, Software Logistics focus shifted from web applications to line of business mobile apps.  At this time the dominant player was
Pocket PC and Windows Mobile.  In early 2007 with the introduction of the iPhone and Android Software Logistics re-tooled and
and began developing applications for those platforms.  In 2008 Kevin D. Wolf was awarded as a Microsoft MVP, a recognition only
to a very small number of programmers in the world for his work with Windows Mobile. To this day Kevin D. Wolf has annually been
reawarded this honor.</p>
<p>After a decade of building mobile apps, In 2015 Software Logistics began to shift it's focus to the Internet of Things or IoT.
Prior to starting Software Logistics, Kevin D. Wolf developed hardware and software for embedded systems for Weigh-Tronix so
transitioning back to controlling hardware with software was a natural fit.  After designing numerous microcontroller based
circuit board including the NiVek quadcopter platform, Software Logistics started spending some time really understanding
what is involved with an IoT solution.</p>
<p>As with any software solution there are many common components to building an IoT application.  Software Logistics has had
great success in the past building data driven solutions so in the second half of 2016 work was begun creating a design for
a secure data driven platform to build IoT applications where the focus is on configuration not coding, but allows the right
set of integration points to add custom code as necessary.</p>
<p>Software Logistics plans to launch their NuvIoT platform with a limited set of beta customers in the fall of 2017 and general
availability in early 2018.</p>
