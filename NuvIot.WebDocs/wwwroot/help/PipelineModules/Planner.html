<h1>Planner</h1>
<p>...more details coming soon...</p>
<p>The planner is responsible for determine how the incoming messages should be processed. Although you can implement
your own custom planner, which you will use your custom <a href="#/messaging/parsing/messageidparsing">message</a> and <a href="#/messaging/parsing/deviceidparsing">device</a> as configured <a href="#/devices/deviceconfigurations">device configuration</a>
to find a match, once a match is found, the <a href="#/routes/route">route</a> associated with that device configuration is determined
and the steps to process the message are queued up for execution.</p>
<p>Unless you have some very specific needs you should be able to use the standard planner.</p>
