<h1>MSMQ Listener</h1>
<p>NuvIoT provides a free, light-weight, built-in MQTT Broker that will get you up and running quickly.<br />
This is a good choice for low-volume and development applications.</p>
<h3>Required Fields</h3>
<p>In addition to the standard fields that are required for any listener, the following fields are required:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Listener Type<br />
<code>MQTT Listener</code></p>
</li>
<li><p>Anonymous Connection<br />
Select this option if your MQTT Server does not require authentication (not recommended).</p>
</li>
<li><p>User Name<br />
User Name with access priveleges to your MQTT Server (if not an anonymous connection).</p>
</li>
<li><p>Password<br />
Password with access priveleges to your MQTT Server (if not an anonymous connection).</p>
</li>
<li><p>Listen on Port<br />
The port that you want to listen for MQTT connections.  This is usually 1883, but you can add additional listeners that run on different ports.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong>  As this is a low-volume listener, primarily intendend for development and non-critical applications, SSL/TLS connections are not supported.</p>
