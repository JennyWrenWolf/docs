<h1>MQTT Listener</h1>
<p>NuvIoT provides a free, light-weight, built-in MQTT Broker that will get you up and running quickly.<br />
This is a good choice for low-volume and development applications.</p>
<h3>Required Fields</h3>
<p>In addition to the <a href="#/Topics/StandardFields.md">standard fields</a> that are required for any listener, the following fields are required:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Listener Type</strong>
<code>MQTT Listener</code></p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Content Type</strong> (required)<br />
Select the <a href="#/Messaging/ContentTypes.md">content type</a> of the message you are expecting, any content types are acceptable.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Listen on Port</strong> (required)<br />
The port that you want to use to listen for MQTT connections.  This is usually 1883, but you can add additional listeners that run on different ports.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Anonymous Connection</strong><br />
Select this option if you do not want to have your devices authenticate with your MQTT broker (not recommended).</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>User Name</strong>  (required if not anonymous)<br />
User Name with access priveleges to your MQTT Server.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Password</strong> (required if not anonymous)<br />
Password with access priveleges to your MQTT Server.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong>  Since this is a low-volume listener, primarily intendend for development and non-critical applications, SSL/TLS connections are not supported.</p>
<h3>Authentication</h3>
<p>In our production version of this broker, we only support a single user authenatication mechanism.  We have an experimental version that
is associated with device id's in your repository.  If you need this, please <a href="http://support.nuviot.com/contactus">contact us</a> and we'll work
with you.</p>
