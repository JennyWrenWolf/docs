<h1>Azure IoT Hub Transmitter</h1>
<p>NuvIoT supports connecting directly to your IoT Hub so you can send messages to your devices.  It is important to realize that, in order to connect to Azure IoT Hub,
you will need to find the URL from the Event Hub-compatible connection string and the Event Hub-compatible name. Refer to this <a href="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/iotdev/2017/05/09/understand-different-connection-strings-in-azure-iot-hub/">Blog Post</a> for more information on IoT Hub Connection Strings.</p>
<p>Also if you are sending a message back to a device that originally connected to an <a href="#/pipelinemodules/listeners/azureiothub">Azure IoT Hub Listener</a> you should use the <a href="#/pipelinemodules/transmitters/originallistener">Original Listener</a> option as your transmitter.</p>
<p>When creating your outgoing message for Azure IoT Hub, you should set the Device ID in the outgoing message of the device where this message should be sent.</p>
<h3>Required Fields</h3>
<p>In addition to the <a href="#/topics/standardfields">standard fields</a> that are required for any transmitter, the following fields are required:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Transmitter Type</strong> (required)<br />
<code>Azure IoT Hub</code></p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Host Name</strong> (required)<br />
Identify the Host Name of the Event Hub-compatible endpoint.  This is not the the primary host name associated with the Azure IoT Hub.
Once you find the Event Hub-compatible endpoint, locate the host.  Leaving out the protocol <code>sb://</code>.<br />
Your Host Name will be something like <code>ihsuprodblres987dednamespace.servicebus.windows.net</code>.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Resource Name</strong> (required)<br />
Enter the Event Hub-compatible name from the Azure site.  This is located just above the Event Hub-compatible endpoint.
You can also create your own custom endpoint via the Azure Portal if you need to listen to a different route.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Access Key Name</strong> (required)<br />
Enter the name of the Access Key (similar to iothubowner, services).  It is important that your key has <code>service connect</code> permissions.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Access Key</strong> (required)<br />
Enter the assigned Access Key for your IoT Hub that was specified in the <strong>Access Key Name</strong> section.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Optional Fields</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Consumer Group</strong><br />
If you do not add a Consumer Group, the <code>$Default</code> Consumer Group will be used.</li>
