<h1>REST Transmitter</h1>
<p>A simple yet powerful option to send messages to other systems is to use the REST Transmitter, this will take <a href="#/messaging/outgoingmessages">Outgoing Message Definition</a>
as procesed by the <a href="#/pipelinemodules/outputtranslator">Output Translator</a> and send them to a REST endpoint.</p>
<p>As part of your <a href="#/messaging/outgoingmessages">Outgoing Message Definition</a> you have the option to provide a REST Method, if you do not provide one, the transmitter will
assume it's a <code>GET</code> method.</p>
<h3>Required Fields</h3>
<p>In addition to the <a href="#/topics/standardfields">standard fields</a> that are required for any transmitter, the following fields are required:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Transmitter Type</strong> (required)<br />
<code>REST</code></p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Host Name</strong>  (required)<br />
Provide the protocol and domain name of that server that you wish to send the message to.<br />
Although you can enter a path, that path should come from the <a href="#/messaging/outgoingmessages">Outgoing Message Definition</a>.  An exception to this is a partial path that will be used to
send all the messages to on the server.<br />
The REST Transmittter supports sending <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol">HTTP</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTPS">HTTPS</a> messages as specified in the Host Name.</p>
<p>Examples:</p>
<pre><code>https://myserver.com
http://myserver.com
http://myserver.com:9353
</code></pre>
<p>If you wish to add a parital path your Host Name mgith look as follows</p>
<pre><code>https://myserver.com/api
</code></pre>
<p>Your host name should not end in a forward slash <code>/</code>, if it is, the transmitter may strip that out if your path from the message starts with a <code>/</code></p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Anonymous Connection</strong><br />
Select this option if your REST server does not require authentication (not recommended).</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>User Name/Password</strong><br />
The user name and password are optional, but if provided will be used to send an authorization header as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_access_authentication">Basic Access authentication</a>.  We understand
this may not meet your needs so please <a href="http://support.nuviot.com/contactus?source=resttxauth">contacts us</a> to discuss your specific needs.  You have access to add your own custom headers and you may be able to add a custom authentication header that will be sent along with the request</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Headers</strong><br />
In addition to the headers that will come from the message you can add additional headers that will be sent along with the request.</p>
</li>
</ul>
