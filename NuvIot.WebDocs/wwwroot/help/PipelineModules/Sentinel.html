<p>Have a secure implementation should be a top priority of any IoT application.  NuvIoT provides a dedicated module to ensure the devices
that are sending messages are indeed who they say they are, and if necessary they decrypt the message.</p>
<p>Message level security starts at the device and is completely dependent on it's capabilities and requirements.</p>
<p>Getting security right is very important to us.  If you are reading this, you are an early adopter of our beta program, <a href="http://support.nuviot.com/contactus?source=scurity">contact us</a>
for a free consultation to discuss options that are available to ensure your messages are secure.</p>
