<h1>Device Configurations</h1>
<p>A device configuration consists of two parts:</p>
<ul>
<li>A collection of <a href="#/Routes/Route.md">routes</a></li>
<li>A set of Properties</li>
</ul>
<p>When you create a <a href="#/Deployment/Solution.md">solution</a> you specify a set of <a href="#/PipelineModules/Listener.md">listeners</a> and a
planner as well as any supported device configurations.  The listeners job is to listen for messages, once a message is received
it is passed to the listener that determine the message id and device id.  With those two pieces of information it will attempt
to find a match for a device configuration based on known devices and supported messages types.  If a match is found it will
then use the steps as defined in the route to process the rest of the message.</p>
