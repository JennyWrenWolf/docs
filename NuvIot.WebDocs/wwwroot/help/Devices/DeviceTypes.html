<h1>Device Types</h1>
<p>Without Devices and Sensors you can't have IoT.  At the heart of any IoT system you will find devices and sensors,
hopefully you'll be able to find off the shelf hardware but may need to create custom hardware.  Either way these
devices and sensors will have attributes such as names, model numbers and so on.</p>
<p>You can add device types to help describing devices in your application.  When you create your device type you
will need to give it a name, key and model number you can also add a manufacturer and other meta data about the device type.</p>
<p>Finally you'll need to add a default <a href="#/Devices/DeviceConfigurations.md">Device Configuration</a>.  Since Device Types are used
to provision new devices the default Device Configuration will be selected but can be overrided.</p>
