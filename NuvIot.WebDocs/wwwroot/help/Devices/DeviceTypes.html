<h1>Device Types</h1>
<p>Without devices and sensors, you cannot have IoT.  At the heart of any IoT system, you will find devices and sensors.
Ideally, you will be able to find off-the-shelf hardware, but you may need to create custom hardware.  Either way, these
devices and sensors will have attributes such as names, model numbers, etc.</p>
<p>You can add Device Types to help describe devices in your application.  When you create your Device Type, you
will need to give it a name, key, and model number.  You can also add a manufacturer and other metadata about the Device Type.</p>
<p>Finally, you will need to add a default <a href="#/Devices/DeviceConfigurations.md">Device Configuration</a>.  Since Device Types are used
to provision new devices, the default Device Configuration will be selected but can be overridden.</p>
