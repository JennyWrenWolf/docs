<h1>Azure IoT Hub Device Repository</h1>
<p>If you are using Azure IoT Hub to connect your devices, you will need to use the Azure IoT Hub Device Repository.</p>
<p>To maintain consistent data, NuvIoT currently requires you to use the NuvIoT built-in Device Repository Editor to provision and update your devices.<br />
If you need afeature that is not available in our built-in Management Console, please <a href="http://support.nuviot.com/contactus?source=auzreiothubrepo">Contact Us</a> so that we can work with you to meet your needs.</p>
