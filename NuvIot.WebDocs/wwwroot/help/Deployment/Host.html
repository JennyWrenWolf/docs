<h1>Host</h1>
<p>A <strong>Host</strong> is a single or collection of compute resources that have been created to manage our IoT application.  A <strong>Host</strong>
is the runtime that runs your <a href="#/deployment/instance">instance</a></p>
<h2>Host States</h2>
<h4>Startup Sequence</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Offline</strong> - Host is not allocated, you are not being billed for any compute resources being associated with this host.</li>
<li><strong>Deploying</strong> - Compute resources are being allocated for this host, as there is confirmation that the host is online, you will start to be billed for this compute resource.</li>
<li><strong>Configuring DNS</strong> - A process is being executed to create an A DNS Record for the assigned IP address of your host.</li>
<li><strong>Deploying Container</strong> - Now your host is ready and at this point any containers associated with your host are being downloaded and installed.</li>
<li><strong>Starting Container</strong> - At this point, your host is completely configured and the instance associated with the container is being started.</li>
<li><strong>Running</strong> - Your <a href="#/deployment/instance">instance</a> is running in the container and the status of the instance will refelect the current status of your runtime.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Server Activities</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Restarting Host</strong> - The compute resouce/operating systems is being restarted.</li>
<li><strong>Restarting Container</strong> - The container containing the instance is being stopped and started.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Error Conditions</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Failed Deployment</strong> - The compute resource did not get created properly.  You will not be charged while the resource is in this state, to restart your host you will need to use the <strong>Remove Host</strong> feature
in the Instance Manager.</li>
<li><strong>Failed Health Check</strong> - Your server is checked once a minute to ensure it is online and responding, if your server doesn't response it's status will be set to <strong>Failed Health Check</strong>.
<strong>Note:</strong> Although this likely means that the instance is also offline, this check is purely against the host, not your instance.</li>
</ul>
